      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <p>
        As a mother of two, one of whom has special needs, I’ve experienced firsthand the importance of life insurance. My husband and I quickly realized that protecting our children’s future in case something happens to either of us is crucial. This personal experience inspired me to become an insurance agent—not only to safeguard my own family, but also to help educate and protect other families.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m passionate about helping others secure the financial protection they need to navigate life’s uncertainties, so they can have peace of mind knowing their loved ones will be taken care of. I offer a wide range of insurance solutions to meet your unique needs. Whether you're looking for life insurance, mortgage protection, coverage for children, or retirement solutions, I have you covered. Additionally, I offer a special program designed to help you get out of debt early, providing a clear path to financial freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Getting life insurance is simple, and it can ease the financial burden on your family during difficult times. With access to over 30 carriers and no medical exams required, I can find a policy that fits your budget.
